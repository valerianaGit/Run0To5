# Run0To5

## Purpose of this app
Hi guys, this is a basic, one view controller app for iOS written in Swift. It is meant to train you to run in intervals from 0 to 5. I just found all other training apps to have too many bells and whistles. 

### Story of building a UI
Decided to share with you guys the journey to building this UI. First draft, progression and ultimately what it looks like right now.
